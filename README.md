Setup
The website was created and tested using localhost on xampp and only Apache needs to be running to use the website. 
The visual studio code live server extension also runs the app as well. This is simpler if xampp isn’t installed or setup. 
It doesn’t look quite as good however it is practically the same. When it comes to the functionality of the app,
I will mention that I wasn’t able to properly sort out the implementation of the models as I would have liked as 
I spent well over the amount of time making them than I should have. The horse animation bugs out even though it was fine in blender, 
and they also don’t loop as I would have liked. I will add videos of what the animations look like in blender along with the blender files to the GitHub. 
Also, the animations need to be paused and then played to active as they automatically play when a user clicked the page.
It seems like the embed YouTube videos also won’t play on local host even with /embed/ in the URL.
